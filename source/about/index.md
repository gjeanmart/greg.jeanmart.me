## Career Profile

Passionate Software Engineer, I enjoy constantly pushing my personal and professional boundaries to new horizons. I am currently living in Auvergne (France) and working as CTO of [Multis](https://multis.co).

Since 2016, I am an active member in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency space and more precisely within the [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) community, I am a true believer of digital decentralization, especially in Finance and a privacy advocate.

My key values are converging between **team spirit**, **open-source**, **transparency** and **knowledge sharing**. I am a constant learner, problem solver and hard worker who love contributing to something greater than me.

Before moving to the blockchain space, I worked in Finance and IT as Lead Developer, Software Architect and Technical Manager in Europe (London, Paris, Brussels) for large and small companies in a wide range of areas (Finance, Insurance, Energy, Media).

In my free time, I appreciate traveling and discovering new cultures, going out with friends for a beer or a movie, playing Jazz music and building personal projects with Raspberry Pi.
Last but not least, I am a proud husband & father, and happy owner of a lovely Dachshund.

## Professional Experiences

### [Multis](https://multis.co) • CTO (Apr. 2021 to present) & Lead Engineer (Apr. 2020 to Mar. 2021)

[Multis](https://multis.co) is a small and ambitious startup building the future of business banking and spend management with crypto-currencies and Blockchain technologies to help businesses access and leverage open finance¹.

As a CTO, I'm responsible for building and maintaining our current and future products at the crossroads of spending and treasury management, banking, crypto-currencies, and Decentralized Finance², as well as leading and hiring a world-class engineering team to address the challenges of today and tomorrow.

I work in collaboration with other engineers, product & ops people to research, develop and scale various financial solutions to support our customers. We designed a platform for crypto-native businesses and organizations offering safety, robustness, and easiness across many functions such as bookkeeping, treasury management, crypto wallets & payments, decentralized finance, on/off-ramp, business banking, and corporate cards. Multis strives to integrate with large Fintech/Crypto players (e.g: [SAFE](https://safe.global), [SynapseFi](https://synapsefi.com/), [Plaid](https://plaid.com), [Powens](https://powens.com), [Bridge.xyz](https://bridge.xyz), [Vezgo](https://vezgo.com)) while maintaining high UI/UX standards to streamline finance operations.

Multis is backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Coinbase Venture and Y Combinator³.

### [Kauri](https://kauri.io) • Senior Software Engineer / Co-Founder (Oct. 2017 - Apr. 2020)

[Kauri](https://kauri.io) was a project incubated by [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net) aiming to primarily improve the on-boarding experience for web3 developers with a platform to learn, share, contribute and maintain high-quality technical content¹. The platform was built on top of decentralized technologies securing data on IPFS and Ethereum to bring trustless content ownership, content incentivization (bounties, tips) and provide an open-by-default API to distribute content².

I worked in collaboration with other engineers to design, build and maintain Kauri as a decentralized protocol and platform. I was also regularly involved in the company, content and product strategies as a founding member.

During that time, Kauri.io and Consensys also strived to promote educational content to beginner and advanced Blockchain developers online or IRL (events, conferences, hackhaton)³.
