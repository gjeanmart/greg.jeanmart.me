## Career Profile

Passionate Software Engineer, I enjoy constantly pushing my personal and professional boundaries to new horizons. I am currently living in Bordeaux (France) and working as CTO of [Multis](https://multis.co).

Since 2016, I am an active member in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency space and more precisely within the [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) community, I am a true believer of digital decentralization, especially in Finance and a privacy advocate.

My key values are converging between team spirit, open-source, transparency and knowledge sharing. I am a constant learner, problem solver and hard worker who love contributing to something greater than me.

Before moving to the blockchain space, I worked in Finance and IT as Lead Developer, Software Architect and Technical Manager in Europe (London, Paris, Brussels) for large and small companies in a wide range of areas (Finance, Insurance, Energy, Media).

In my free time, I appreciate traveling and discovering new cultures, going out with friends for a beer or a movie, playing Jazz music and building personal projects with Raspberry Pi.
Last but not least, I am a proud husband and happy owner of a lovely Dachshund.
