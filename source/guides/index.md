While working on [kauri.io](https://kauri.io) between 2017 and 2020, I wrote a bunch of tech articles and guides around Blockchain and self-hosting to contribute to our platform. You will find below some of them that I moved back here. I will try to keep them up-to-date and create new ones in the future.
