title: Guides

When I was working on [kauri.io](https://kauri.io) between 2017 and 2020, I wrote a bunch of tech articles and guides around Blockchain and self-hosting to contribute to the platform (dog fooding). Please find below some of them that I moved back here. I will try to keep them up-to-date and create new ones.
